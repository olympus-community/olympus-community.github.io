The two HLRP Content Packs contain custom assets such as player models, icons, textures, sound fonts, and more. Without these packs, you will see missing textures and errors instead of actual models.</p><p>It’s always best practice to check and download the required content packs before joining any server.</p><h2 id="_2-use-the-64-bit-x86-64-beta-version-of-garry-s-mod" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-use-the-64-bit-x86-64-beta-version-of-garry-s-mod"><span>2.

The default version is only 32-bit, which limits your PC’s performance and can cause FPS drops and in-game glitches. Switching to the 64-bit version will allow better utilization of your system’s resources.</p><h2 id="_3-read-and-follow-the-server-roleplay-rules" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-read-and-follow-the-server-roleplay-rules"><span>3.

Here are some possible paths you can take:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Grind for wealth</strong> – Focus on farming money, crafting, and trading to accumulate wealth. With enough money, you can fund various activities, such as supporting a resistance movement by purchasing superior weaponry, body armor, and equipment for your rebel group, making them more powerful than Civil Protection. Or, you could simply open a bakery shop in the plaza!</p></li><li><p><strong>Join Civil Protection</strong> – Become a loyal citizen by enlisting in the Civil Protection recruitment program. Assist them in uncovering rebel plans, creating propaganda posters, and reporting suspicious individuals.</p></li></ul><p>Your roleplay journey is entirely up to you—whether you rise to power, fight for freedom, or simply live a peaceful life in the city, the choice is yours!</p>',18)]))}const c=t(o,[["render",s],["__file","getting_started.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/getting_started.html","title":"Getting Started","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"1.
